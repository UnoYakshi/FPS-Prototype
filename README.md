# FPS PvE Prototype
There are a several main project's ideas:
1. Magazine-based weapons system with multiple firing modes (single, burst, auto).
2. ArchViz-like level design for a shooting range level.
3. Proof of interactive-world-concept.
4. Test out visual (CameraShake, true FPS view, AimOffset, etc.) and sound FXs' power on flow-feel.
5. Player vs. Environment matchmaking (standard client-server architecture).
6. C++-centered codebase (against BP-biased).
