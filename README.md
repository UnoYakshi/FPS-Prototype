# FPS-Prototype
This project is a showcase of:
* world interaction is easy to set-up, and interesting to have within the game
* 
* shooting the firearms can and should feel tough+realistic despite of the weapon's type (handgun, rifle, machinegun, etc.)

## TL & DR
Reasonable level design, rich and realistic world interaction, noticable shooting.
