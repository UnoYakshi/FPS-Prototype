# FPS-Prototype
There are a few main project's ideas:
1. Create a shooting range level for TFPS (tactical FPS) for future weapons tests.
2. Proof of interactive-world-concept. 
3. Test out visual (CameraShake, animtations) and sound FXs power on flow-feel.

## TL & DR
Reasonable level design, rich and realistic world interaction, noticable shooting.

## Tools/Credits
