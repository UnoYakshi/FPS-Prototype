# R.O.C.
R.O.C. is intended to be PvE co-op true first-person shooter with modern Russia setting where Orthodox Church has taken over the government. You play the role of both bounty and monster hunter.

Aside from practice and making cool game, there are some main project's ideas:

Gameplay features are:
* you are hunting slavic mythical creatures and Orthodox heretics
* projectile- and magazine-based gunplay with somewhat realistic damage
* somewhat somberly humorous dialogues
* multiple factions and enemies
* stronger bots are smarter and well-equiped not just sponges for bullets 

Meta/Tech features:
* Player vs. Environment only
* true first-person camera â€” a single mesh per character, the camera is in the eyes, attached to the head
* MMO/session game:
  * limited number of player per server
  * server's lobby is MMO
  * server's missons are isolated (think of dungeons)

## Tools
* [Unreal Engine 4](https://www.unrealengine.com/)
